KOMODO-CSS-PERSENT-CODER consists of three parts:
 1. Javascript code to convert a scalable vector graphics (SVG) image to a percentage code (CSS-present-code.ktf).
 2. Javascript code for the reverse operation - converting the percentage format code to SVG code (CSS-persent-encode.ktf).
 3. Javascript code to convert Jpeg and Png images to BASE64 format and insert this code into a CSS document.

Each of the parts is for use in the ACTIVESTATE KOMODO EDIT and ACTIVESTATE KOMODO IDE.
